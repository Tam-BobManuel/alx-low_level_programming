<h1>C - Debugging</h1>
This repository contains solutions to debugging problems in C programming language.

<h2>Files</h2>
The repository contains the following files:

  <h3>0-main.c</h3>
This program tests the positive_or_negative() function with an input of 0.

<h3>1-main.c</h3>
This program previously caused an infinite loop but the loop is now avoided.

<h3>2-main.c</h3>
This program prints the largest of three integers.

<h3>2-largest_number.c</h3>
This program contains the function largest_number() which returns the largest of three numbers.

<h3>3-print_remaining_days.c</h3>
This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year.

<h3>main.h</h3>
This file contains the header file for all the programs.

<h2>How to use</h2>
To use these programs, compile them using a C compiler such as gcc and run the executable. For example, to run the 0-main.c program, use the following commands:
$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-main.c -o 0-main
$ ./0-main
